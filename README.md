# WhatsApp-Group-Chat-Analysis
Cleaning and analyzing WhatsApp group chat data as well as report design in PowerBI

# Introduction
This project resulted from a search for a pet project (passion project) that would involve working with data that was personal and which the insights would be interesting to see. 
This analysis was carried out to find out the total users of the group over the years 2022- 2024, the most contributing users, gender contribution, message count, chat trends, and peak time.

Conclusion
# Data Gathering & Transformation
To get the WhatsApp chat data, I simply exported the chat from the WhatsApp group by navigating to the ellipsis at the top right corner of the group chat and selected "Export Chat". That exported the chat as a text file. However, with this method, one is limited to only nearly 6,000 messages (without media, chat backup, and updates). The exported chats needed to be transformed for ease of analysis and it was done using Power Query in Excel and powerBI for creating added measures.

Report Requirement
While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see the overall trend of conversations in the group and identify what period the most conversations took place. However, during the report design, I was also interested in creating a report that lets the individual members of the group see their level of activity in the group over time. In summary, the reporting requirement was to provide an overall trend of group activity and let each group member see their activity.
